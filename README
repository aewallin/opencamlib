OpenCAMLib README

1. INTRODUCTION
OpenCAMLib (ocl) is a c++ library for creating toolpaths for cnc-machines
such as mills and lathes.

The project is hosted at
http://code.google.com/p/opencamlib/

The mailing-list for general development and user-discussion is:
http://groups.google.com/group/opencamlib

SVN commit messages go to a mailing-list:
http://groups.google.com/group/opencamlib-svn

2. BUILDING and INSTALLING (on unix/debian-like systems)
cd into the /src directory, then run
 $> cmake .
this creates a Makefile, and build with
 $> make 
this should create the ocl library as a file "ocl.so" in the /src directory
 $> sudo make install
will install the ocl.so library and camvtk.py so that any python shell will find them.

 
if you also want to build the documentation, then run
 $> make doc
and
 $> make doc-pdf
this should create the ocl manual named "ocl-manual.pdf" in the src/doc directory

3. ORGANIZATION OF FILES
(generate this with 'tree -dL2')

|-- Windows             Visual-studio project for building on windows
|-- debian              files for building a debian package
|-- lib                 libraries
|-- scripts             python scripts that test or demonstrate use of ocl
|-- src                 source files
|   `-- attic           old source files and experimental code
`-- stl                 STL files for testing

4. Ubuntu 10.04LTS install and build
- install 64-bit Ubuntu 10.04LTS
- run update manager and install all suggested updates. reboot
- using synaptic or apt-get install the following packages(and their dependencies)
-- build-essential
-- cmake
-- subversion
-- doxygen
-- texlive-latex-base
-- libboost1.40-all-dev
- checkout ocl from svn
- in the /src directory, first run "cmake ." and the "make"
this should build ocl correctly.
